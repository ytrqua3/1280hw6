AERIE, [=a]'ri, or [=e]'ri, _n._ the nest of any bird of prey, esp. an
eagle: a house perched on some high or steep place: (_Shak._) the brood in
the nest, or a stock of children.--Also AERY, EYRIE, EYRY. [O. Fr. _aire_;
Low L. _aeria_, _aerea_--L. _area_, a spot of level ground. The form EYRY
seems to have been originally due to a confusion with M. E. _ey_, an egg.]
