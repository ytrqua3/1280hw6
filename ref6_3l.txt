APRIL, [=a]'pril, _n._ the fourth month of the year.--_n._ A'PRIL-FOOL, one
sent upon a bootless errand on the 1st of April, perhaps a relic of some
old Celtic heathen festival. In Scotland called _gowk_ (a cuckoo, a fool).
[L. _Aprilis_, usually regarded as from _aperire_, as the month when the
earth opens to bring forth new fruits.]
