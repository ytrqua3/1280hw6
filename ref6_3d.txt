ALOE, al'[=o], _n._ a genus of plants of considerable medicinal importance,
of the 200 species of which as many as 170 are indigenous to the Cape
Colony.--The so-called American Aloe is a totally different plant (see
AGAVE).--_adj._ AL'OED, planted or shaded with aloes.--The ALOES WOOD of
the Bible was the heart-wood of _Aquilaria ovata_ and _Aquilaria
Agallochum_, large spreading trees. The wood contains a dark-coloured,
fragrant, resinous substance, much prized for the odour it diffuses in
burning. [The word was used erroneously in the Septuagint and New Testament
as a translation of the Heb. _ah[=a]l[=i]m_, _ah[=a]l[=o]th_ (Gr.
_agallochon_), an aromatic resin or wood--called later in Gr. _xylalo[=e]_,
from which descend _lignum aloes_, _lign-aloes_, _wood-aloes_, and
_aloes-wood_.--A.S. _aluwan_--L. _alo[=e]_--Gr. _alo[=e]_.]
